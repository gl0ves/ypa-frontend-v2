## This is a Svelte 5 project, always use the new runes syntax:
```
<!-- State -->
let foo = $state("")
<!-- Computed -->
const bar = $derived(() => {})
<!-- Effects, similar to useEffect but anything inside will trigger reactivity -->
$effect(() => {})
<!-- For props -->
const { myProp } = $props()
```
## In svelte 5 no ":"
on:click is now onclick

## Emits
Svelte 5 uses hooks, a function is passed to the component
